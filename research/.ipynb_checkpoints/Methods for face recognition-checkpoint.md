### OpenCV
* Local binary patterns with histogram oriented gradients
    * Resilient to total brightness changes
    * Not resilient to changes in lighting
    * A student implemented it and wrote a [report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318900718_Face_Detection_Face_Recognition_Using_Open_Computer_Vision_Classifies)
    
* Eigenfaces
    * Important that faces are in the same lighting conditions and eyes are in the same position.
    * Based on PCA
* Fisherfaces
    * Based on LDA
    * Further development from Eigenfaces
